# Euler - An Evaluation Project

This is a test of your ability to understand Front-end Javascript. Please solve the following problems.

* We're getting an error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '0' of undefined in jquery for some reason - I believe this is causing the stream to disappear
* Once you fix the above error, for some reason on the stream, everyones names is undefined.
* When submitting the sign up form, it refreshes the page but it should just get the data and submit via ajax. The code is all there, but something is missing...
* On the sign up form, if you submit with invalid data, it displays a list of errors on what did not pass validation. It is currently creating the elements in the javascript and setting the html there as well. Given what you can see from the activity stream template, create a template for the error messages and implement that method for displaying errors
* When clicking the links in the navigation, it is supposed to animate the scrolling. The code is there to do it, but it's not working. Fix it.
